# Mood Sense 

I managed to get most of the features from the exam done although the requirements were a bit vague, 
so I had to make some assumptions. I also had to make some compromises in order to get the app done in time.

I wrote several tests but with more time i would have completely covered the app with tests.
i however thing the tests i wrote are a good representation of my testing skills.

## Getting started

1. install [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. run `task install` to install dependencies
3. run `task start` to run the app
4. run `task stop` to stop the app
5. run `task test` to run tests
6. run `task clean` to clean up the app

## About the app

this was bootstrapped with my own [cookiecutter](https://github.com/sicksid/django-nextjs-boilerplate)
